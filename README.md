# Hacklily

Hacklily is an online sheet-music editor and publishing tool. [Start writing music now!](https://hacklily.org)

It consists of a frontend [Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/) editor using [monaco](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor)
(the editor that powers vscode) and a backend Lilypond renderer. It can publish songs directly to GitHub.

## Running locally

### Dependencies

> **Important**: You do not need to install anything to run Hacklily in your browser. Hacklily supports all major browsers. To use it, just go to [https://www.hacklily.org](https://www.hacklily.org). The instructions below are for if you want to contribute to Hacklily or run the Hacklily development server _locally_.

You need:

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) -- tested with Node 7, earlier versions may or may not also work
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/)
- [Qt 5](https://www.qt.io/) -- with qmake in your path (installing using the version from Qt's website is recommended on macOS)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

Note: I haven't tested this on Windows yet. Theoretically, this should work with something like MSYS, but I have not tried.
If you manage to get it working, please make a pull request with instructions on how to do that.

### Obtaining

To get hacklily, run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:emilyskidsister/hacklily.git
```

Or, if you do not have ssh auth setup with Github:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emilyskidsister/hacklily.git
```

### Running (without GitHub integration)

Once you have installed the above dependencies, run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
```

Or if using npm:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

To use the remote backend (rather than building your own local renderer), **in place of the `start` command**, use:

```bash
yarn start:remote-backend
```

or:

```bash
npm run start:remote-backend
```

### Running (with GitHub integration)

**For most development, the steps in "Running" (above) are sufficient**.

If you specifically wish to test integration with GitHub, follow the steps in this section.

First, create a GitHub organization by following the steps at https://github.com/organizations/new.
Select the free plan.

Next, create a new app at https://github.com/organizations/your-new-repo-name/settings/applications,
making note of the client ID and secret. This application will be used to allow users to log in.

To run the frontend, in one shell run:

```bash
cd hacklily
yarn
env \
  REACT_APP_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=your_github_api_client_id_here \
  REACT_APP_BACKEND_WS_URL=ws://localhost:2000 \
  yarn start
```

At this point, you should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app, but you
will get an error in the preview pane since the server is not running.

In another shell, to run the backend, run:

```bash
cd hacklily/server
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ../ws-server
make
./ws-server \
  --renderer-path ../renderer \
  --renderer-docker-tag hacklily-renderer \
  --github-client-id your_github_api_client_id_here \
  --github-secret your_github_api_secret_here \
  --ws-port 2000
```

You can omit the `github-*` arguments if you do not want to enable the GitHub integration.

`ws-port` should match the port of the `REACT_APP_BACKEND_WS_URL` you entered above.

Then, in a browser navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
